          <P> We are very pleased about your interest in our company. Data protection is of particular
             importance to the management of Giraf Creatives. Use of the Kistler Maschinen-
              und Anlagenbau GmbH website is generally possible without providing any personal data.
               However, if a data subject wishes to use special services offered by our company via
                our website, processing of personal data may be necessary. If the processing of personal
                 data is necessary and there is no legal basis for such processing, we generally obtain
                  the consent of the data subject.
             </P>
        <p> The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, email address,
           or telephone number of a data subject, is always carried out in accordance
            with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with
             the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to Kistler Maschinen-
              und Anlagenbau GmbH. By means of this data protection declaration, our company
               would like to inform the public about the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal
                data we collect, use, and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed of
                 their rights by means of this data protection declaration.

        </p>
        <p> As the controller, Giraf Creatives has implemented numerous
           technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection possible
            for personal data processed through this website. However, internet-based data transmissions may,
             in principle, contain security gaps, so absolute protection cannot be guaranteed.
              For this reason, every data subject is free to transmit personal data to us via
               alternative means, for example, by telephone.

        </p>
        <h4> Definitions </h4>
<p> The privacy policy of Giraf Creatives is based on the 
  terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection
   Regulation (GDPR). Our privacy policy is intended to be easily readable and understandable
    for the public, as well as for our customers and business partners. To ensure this, 
    we would like to explain the terms used in advance.

</p>
<p> In this privacy policy we use, among other things, the following terms: </p>

<h6> a) personal data </h6>
<p> Personal data is any information relating to an identified or 
  identifiable natural person (hereinafter "data subject"). An identifiable
   natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly,
    in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number,
     location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to
      the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
       identity of that natural person.

</p>
<h6> b) data subject </h6>
<p> Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person whose personal data is processed by the controller.</p>
<h6> c) Processing </h6>
<p> Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal
   data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection,
    recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval,
     consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available,
      alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.

</p>

<h6> d) Restriction of processing </h6>
<p> Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting its future processing.</p>
<h6> e) Profiling </h6>
<p> Profiling is any form of automated processing of personal data consisting
   of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating
   to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning 
   that natural personâ€™s performance at work, economic situation, health, 
   personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.

</p>
<h6> f) Pseudonymization </h6>
<p> Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner
   that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data
    subject without the use of additional information, provided that such
     additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical
      and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not
       attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.

</p>
<h6> g) Controller or person responsible for processing </h6>
<p> The controller or controller responsible for processing is the natural or legal person,
   public authority, agency, or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
    the purposes and means of processing personal data. Where the purposes and means of
     such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the
      specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.

</p>
<h6> h) Processor </h6>
<p> Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller. </p>
<h6> i) Recipient </h6>
<p> Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body to which
   personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities 
   which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance
    with Union or Member State law shall not be considered recipients.

</p>
<h6> j) Third party </h6>
<p> Third party means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other
   than the data subject, the controller, the processor and the persons authorised to
    process the personal data under the direct authority of the controller or processor.

</p>
<h6> k) Consent </h6>
<p> Consent is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's
   wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement 
   to the processing of personal data concerning him or her.

</p>
<h4> 2. Name and address of the controller </h4>
<p> The controller within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation,
   other data protection laws applicable in the Member States of the European Union and other provisions of a data protection nature is:

</p>

<p> Giraf Creatives </p>
<p> Mackstrasse 84 </p>
<p> 88348 Bad Saulgau </p>
<p>  Deutschland </p>
<p> Phone: +(49) 7581 48882 â€“ 0</p>
<p> Email: info@girafcreatives.com </p>
<p> Website: https://girafcreatives.com/de </p>
<h4> 3. Collection of general data and information </h4>
<p> The website of Giraf Creatives collects a series of general
   data and information each time the website is accessed by a data subject or an automated system.
    This general data and information is stored in the server's log files. Collected may be
     (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system,
      (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers),
       (4) the sub-websites accessed via an accessing system on our website,
        (5) the date and time of access to the website, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address),
         (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and
          (8) other similar data and information used to avert dangers in the event
           of attacks on our information technology systems.

</p>
<p> When using this general data and information, Giraf Creatives does
   not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is required to 
   (1) correctly deliver the content of our website, (2) optimize the content of our website 
   and its advertising, (3) ensure the long-term functionality of our information technology
    systems and the technology of our website, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities
     with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in the event of a cyberattack.
      This anonymously collected data and information is therefore evaluated by Kistler Maschinen-
       und Anlagenbau GmbH both statistically and with the aim of increasing data protection
        and data security in our company in order to ultimately ensure an optimal level of protection
         for the personal data we process. The anonymous data in the server log files are stored
          separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.

</p>
<h4> 4. Contact option via the website </h4>
<p> Due to legal regulations, the Giraf Creatives website contains information
   that enables quick electronic contact with our company and direct communication with us,
    which also includes a general address for so-called electronic mail (email address). 
    If a data subject contacts the controller by email or via a contact form, the personal
     data transmitted by the data subject will be automatically stored. Such personal data
      transmitted voluntarily by a data subject to the controller will be stored for the
       purposes of processing or contacting the data subject. This personal data will
        not be passed on to third parties.

</p>

<h4> 5. Routine deletion and blocking of personal data </h4>

<p> The controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only
   for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage or as far as this is
    granted by the European legislator or other legislator in laws or regulations
     to which the controller is subject to.

</p>
<p> If the storage purpose no longer applies or if a storage period prescribed by
   the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data
    will be routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions.

</p>
<h4> 6. Rights of the data subject </h4>
<h6> a) Right to confirmation </h6>
<p> Every data subject has the right granted by the European legislator to obtain confirmation
   from the controller as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed.
    If a data subject wishes to exercise this right of confirmation, he or she may contact an employee of the controller at any time.

</p>
<h6> b) Right to information </h6>
<p> Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right,
   granted by the European legislator, to obtain from the controller free information
    about the personal data concerning him or her stored at any time, including a copy
     of that information. Furthermore, the European legislator has granted the data
      subject the right to obtain the following information:

</p>

<ul class="rights-data"> 
  <li>  the processing purposes </li>
  <li>  the categories of personal data being processed  </li>
  <li>  the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed,
   in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations </li>
  <li>  where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, where not possible, the criteria used to determine that period </li>
  <li>  the existence of a right to rectification or erasure of personal data concerning
   him or her or to restriction of processing by the controller or a right to object to such processing </li>
  <li>  the existence of a right of complaint to a supervisory authority </li>
  <li>  if the personal data are not collected from the data subject: all available information about the origin of the data </li>

  22 (1) and (4) GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about </li>
  <li>  the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject </li>
  
</ul>

<p> Furthermore, the data subject has the right to information as to
   whether personal data has been transferred to a third country or to an
    international organization. If so, the data subject also has the right
     to receive information about the appropriate safeguards in connection with the transfer.

</p>
<p> If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to information, he or she may contact an employee of the controller at any time. </p>
 <h6> c) Right to rectification </h6>
 <p> Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted
   by the European legislator to request the immediate rectification of inaccurate
    personal data concerning him or her. Furthermore, the data subject has the right
     to request the completion of incomplete personal data, including by means of
      providing a supplementary statement, taking into account the purposes of the processing.

 </p>
 <p> If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may contact an employee of the controller at any time. </p>
 <h6> d) Right to erasure (right to be forgotten) </h6>
 <p> Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by
   the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data
    concerning him or her without undue delay, where one of the following grounds applies and where processing is not necessary:

 </p>

<ul class="rights-data">
  <li> The personal data were collected or otherwise processed for purposes for which they are no longer necessary. </li>
  <li> The data subject withdraws his or her consent on which the processing is based according to point (a)
     of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and there is no other legal ground for the processing.
     </li>
  <li> The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR and there are no
     overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 (2) GDPR.
     </li>
  <li> The personal data was processed unlawfully. </li>
  <li> The erasure of personal data is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. </li>
  <li> The personal data were collected in relation to information society services offered in accordance with Article 8 (1) GDPR. </li>
  
</ul>
<p> If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request
   the erasure of personal data stored by Giraf Creatives,
    they may contact an employee of the controller at any time. The employee of Kistler Maschinen-
     und Anlagenbau GmbH will ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.

</p>
<p> If the personal data was made public by Giraf Creatives and our
   company as the controller pursuant to Art. 17 Para. 1 GDPR is obliged to erase the personal
    data, Giraf Creatives shall take appropriate measures,
     including technical ones, taking into account the available technology and the implementation costs,
      in order to inform other data controllers which process the published personal data that the data
       subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of all links to these personal data or
        of copies or replications of these personal data, unless processing is required.
         The employee of Giraf Creatives will arrange the necessary
          measures in individual cases.

</p>

<h6> e) Right to restriction of processing </h6>
<p> Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the European
   legislator to request the controller to restrict processing if one of the following conditions applies:

</p>
<ul class="rights-data">
  <li> The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject,
     for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.
     </li>
  <li> The processing is unlawful, the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal
     data and requests the restriction of the use of the personal data instead.
     </li>
  <li> The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but the data subject needs them to assert,
     exercise or defend legal claims.
     </li>
  <li> The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR and it has not yet been
     determined whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.
     </li> 
</ul>

<p> If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request
   the restriction of personal data stored by Giraf Creatives, 
   he or she may contact an employee of the controller at any time. The employee of
    Giraf Creatives will arrange for the restriction of processing.

</p>
<h6> f) Right to data portability </h6>

<p> Every data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to receive the personal
   data concerning him or her, which he or she has provided to a controller, in a structured,
    commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall also have the right to transmit 
    those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal
     data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point
      (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR or on a contract
       pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by
        automated means, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried
         out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. 

</p>
<p> Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) GDPR,
   the data subject shall have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one
    controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

</p>

<p> To assert the right to data portability, the data subject may contact an employee of Giraf Creatives at any time.</p>
<h6> g) Right to object</h6>
<p> Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the European legislator 
  to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning him or her, which is based on Article 
  6 (1) (e) or (f) GDPR, for reasons related to his or her particular situation. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.

</p>

<p> In the event of an objection, Giraf Creatives will no longer process the personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which outweigh the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
   </p>
<p> If Giraf Creatives processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data for such advertising purposes. This also applies to profiling insofar as it is associated with such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to Giraf Creatives processing the data for direct marketing purposes, Giraf Creatives will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.
   </p>
<p> In addition, the data subject has the right to object to the processing of personal data concerning him or her by Giraf Creatives for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Art. 89 (1) GDPR, for reasons related to his or her particular situation, unless such processing is necessary to perform a task carried out in the public interest.
   </p>
<p> To exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of Giraf Creatives or another employee directly. Furthermore, in connection with the use of information society services, the data subject is free to exercise their right of objection by means of automated procedures using technical specifications, notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC.
   </p>
   <h6> h) Automated decisions in individual cases, including profiling</h6>
<p> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her, unless the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and the controller, or (2) is authorized by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subjectâ€™s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is based on the data subjectâ€™s explicit consent.
   </p>
<p> If the decision (1) is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or (2) is made with the data subjectâ€™s explicit consent, Giraf Creatives shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subjectâ€™s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision.
   </p>
<p> If the data subject wishes to exercise rights with regard to automated decisions, he or she may contact any employee of the controller at any time. </p>

<h6> i) Right to withdraw consent under data protection law</h6>
<p> Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to the processing of personal data at any time.

</p>
<p> If the data subject wishes to exercise his or her right to withdraw consent, he or she may contact an employee of the controller at any time.</p>
<h4> 7. Data protection in applications and during the application process</h4>
<p> The controller collects and processes the personal data of applicants for the purpose of processing the application procedure. Processing may also be carried out electronically. This is particularly the case if an applicant submits corresponding application documents to the controller electronically, for example by email or via a web form on the website. If the controller concludes an employment contract with an applicant, the transmitted data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with the statutory provisions. If the controller does not conclude an employment contract with the applicant, the application documents will be automatically deleted two months after notification of the rejection decision, provided that no other legitimate interests of the controller conflict with deletion. Other legitimate interests in this sense include, for example, the burden of proof in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).

</p>
<h4> 8. Data protection provisions regarding the application and use of Facebook</h4>

<p> The controller has integrated components of the Facebook company into this website. Facebook is a social network.</p>

<p> A social network is an internet-based social meeting place, an online community that typically allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network can serve as a platform for exchanging opinions and experiences or allow the internet community to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook allows users of the social network to create private profiles, upload photos, and network via friend requests, among other things.

</p>
<p> The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. If a data subject lives outside the USA or Canada, the controller responsible for processing personal data is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.

</p>
<p> Each time one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by the controller and on which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-in) has been integrated, is accessed, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted by the respective Facebook component to download a display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook. A complete overview of all Facebook plug-ins can be found at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=de_DE. As part of this technical process, Facebook receives information about which specific subpage of our website was visited by the data subject.

</p>
<p> If the data subject is logged in to Facebook at the same time, Facebook recognizes which specific subpage of our website the data subject visits with each visit to our website by the data subject and for the entire duration of their stay on our website. This information is collected through the Facebook component and assigned by Facebook to the respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks one of the Facebook buttons integrated on our website, e.g. the "Like" button, or if the data subject makes a comment, Facebook assigns this information to the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores this personal data.

</p>
<p> Facebook always receives information via the Facebook component that the data subject has visited our website, provided that the data subject is logged in to Facebook at the time of accessing our website; this occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If the data subject does not want this information to be transmitted to Facebook, they can prevent this by logging out of their Facebook account before accessing our website.

</p>
<p> The data policy published by Facebook, available at https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing, and use of personal data by Facebook. It also explains which settings options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject. Furthermore, various applications are available that allow the suppression of data transmission to Facebook. Such applications can be used by the data subject to suppress data transmission to Facebook.

</p>
<h4> 9. Data protection provisions regarding the application and use of YouTube</h4>
<p> The controller has integrated YouTube components into this website. YouTube is an internet video portal that allows video publishers to upload video clips free of charge and other users to view, rate, and comment on them free of charge. YouTube allows the publication of all types of videos, which is why both complete film and television programs, as well as music videos, trailers, and videos created by users themselves, are available via the internet
   portal. </p>
<p> The operator of YouTube is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. YouTube, LLC is a subsidiary of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
   </p>
<p> Each time one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by the controller and on which a YouTube component (YouTube video) has been integrated, is accessed, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted by the respective YouTube component to download a display of the corresponding YouTube component from YouTube. Further information about YouTube can be found at https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/de/. As part of this technical process, YouTube and Google receive information about which specific subpage of our website was visited by the data subject.
   </p>
<p> If the data subject is logged in to YouTube at the same time, YouTube recognizes which specific subpage of our website the data subject is visiting when they access a subpage containing a YouTube video. This information is collected by YouTube and Google and assigned to the respective YouTube account of the data subject.
   </p>
<p> YouTube and Google always receive information via the YouTube component that the data subject has visited our website, provided the data subject is logged in to YouTube at the same time as accessing our website; this occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on a YouTube video or not. If the data subject does not want this information to be transmitted to YouTube and Google, they can prevent this by logging out of their YouTube account before accessing our website.
   </p>
<p> The privacy policy published by YouTube, which is available at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by YouTube and Google.
   </p>
<h4>10. Legal basis for processing</h4>

<p> Art. 6 I lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for our company for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of other services or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. The same applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation which requires the processing of personal data, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and their name, age, health insurance details or other vital information had to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third parties. In that case, the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d GDPR.
   </p>
<p> Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations that are not covered by any of the above-mentioned legal grounds if the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override them. We are permitted to carry out such processing operations in particular because they were specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, the European legislator took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a customer of the controller (Recital 47, Sentence 2 GDPR).
   </p>
   <h4> 11. Legitimate interests in the processing pursued by the controller or a third party</h4>
<p> If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit. f GDPR, our legitimate interest is the conduct of our business activities for the benefit of the well-being of all our employees and our shareholders.
   </p>
   <h4>12. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h4>
<p> The criterion for the duration of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of this period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted unless it is no longer required for the fulfillment or initiation of a contract.
   </p>
   <h4> 13. Legal or contractual provisions for the provision of personal data; necessity for the conclusion of the contract; obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of non-provision 

   </h4>
<p> We would like to clarify that the provision of personal data is sometimes required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also arise from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).
   </p>
<p> Sometimes it may be necessary for a data subject to provide us with personal data in order to conclude a contract, which must then be processed by us. For example, the data subject is obliged to provide us with personal data if our company concludes a contract with him or her. Failure to provide the personal data would mean that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.
   </p>
<p> Before the data subject provides personal data, the data subject must contact one of our employees. Our employee will clarify to the data subject on a case-by-case basis whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and what the consequences of non-provision of the personal data would be.
   </p>
   <h4> 14. Existence of automated decision-making</h4>
<p> As a responsible company, we do not use automated decision-making or profiling. </p>
