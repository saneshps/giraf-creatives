        <div class="col-md-12 privacy-first"> 
          
 
   
<h4> I. Offer</h4>
<p class="condition-p"> The documents accompanying the offer, such as illustrations, drawings, weights, and dimensions, are only approximate unless expressly designated as binding. The supplier reserves ownership and copyright to cost estimates, drawings, and other documents; they may not be made accessible to third parties. The supplier is obligated to disclose plans designated as confidential by the customer to third parties only with the customer's consent.

</p>
   
<h4> II. Scope of delivery </h4>
<p class="condition-p">  The scope of delivery is determined by the supplier's written order confirmation; in the case of a time-bound offer from the supplier with timely acceptance, the offer itself shall be decisive, unless a timely order confirmation is received. Subsidiary agreements and changes require the supplier's written confirmation.
    </p>
   
<h4> III. Price and Payment </h4>  
<ul class="condition-ul">
 <li> Unless otherwise agreed, prices are ex works, including loading at the factory, but excluding packaging.
VAT at the applicable statutory rate is added to the prices. </li>
 <li> Unless otherwise agreed, payment is to be made in cash without any deductions to the supplier's payer, namely: 1/3 deposit upon receipt of the order confirmation, 1/3 as soon as the customer is informed that the main parts are ready for dispatch, the remaining amount within one month.
   </li>
 <li> Withholding payments or offsetting against any counterclaims of the Purchaser that are disputed by the Supplier are not permitted.
   </li> 
</ul>
 
   
<h4> IV. Delivery time

</h4>
<ul class="condition-ul">
 <li> The delivery period begins with the dispatch of the order confirmation, but not before the provision of the documents, approvals and releases to be provided by the customer and before an agreed down payment.
   </li>
 <li> The delivery period is met if the delivery item has left the factory or if readiness for dispatch has been communicated by the deadline
   </li>
 <li> The delivery period shall be extended appropriately in the event of industrial action, particularly strikes and lockouts, as well as in the event of unforeseen obstacles beyond the control of the supplier, provided that such obstacles demonstrably have a significant impact on the completion or delivery of the delivery item. This also applies if the circumstances occur at subcontractors. The supplier is not responsible for the aforementioned circumstances, even if they arise during an existing delay. In important cases, the supplier will notify the customer of the start and end of such obstacles as soon as possible.
   </li>
 <li> If the purchaser suffers damages due to a delay caused by the supplier's own fault, the purchaser is entitled, to the exclusion of any further claims, to claim compensation for the delay. This compensation shall amount to 0.5% for each full week of delay, but not exceeding 5% of the value of that part of the total delivery that cannot be used on time or in accordance with the contract due to the delay.
   </li>
 <li> If shipment is delayed at the customer's request, the customer will be charged for the storage costs, starting one month after notification of readiness for shipment. If storage takes place at the supplier's premises, the costs will be at least 1/2% of the invoice amount for each month. However, the supplier is entitled, in accordance with the terms of the contract and if a reasonable period of time has elapsed without result, to dispose of the delivery item in another way and to deliver to the customer within a reasonably extended period.
   </li>
 <li> Compliance with the delivery deadline requires the fulfillment of the customer’s contractual obligations. </li>
</ul>
 
   
<h4> V. Transfer of risk and acceptance </h4>
<ul class="condition-ul">
 <li> The risk shall pass to the customer at the latest upon dispatch of the delivery items, even if partial deliveries are made or the supplier has assumed other services, such as shipping costs or delivery and installation. At the customer's request, the supplier will insure the shipment at the customer's expense against theft, breakage, transport, fire, and water damage, as well as other insurable risks.
   </li>
 <li> If shipment is delayed due to circumstances for which the Purchaser is responsible, the risk shall pass to the Purchaser from the date the goods are ready for shipment; however, the Supplier shall be obliged, at the Purchaser's request and expense, to arrange any insurance required by the Purchaser.
   </li>
 <li> Delivered items must be accepted by the Purchaser, even if they have minor defects, without prejudice to the rights under Section VII.
   </li>
 <li> Partial deliveries are permitted. </li>
 
</ul>
 
   
<h4> VI. Retention of title </h4>
<ul class="condition-ul">
 <li> The supplier reserves ownership of the delivery item until all payments arising from the delivery contract have been received. </li>
 <li> The Supplier is entitled to insure the delivery item against theft, breakage, fire, water and other damage at the Purchaser's expense, unless the Purchaser has demonstrably taken out the insurance himself.
   </li>
 <li> The purchaser may neither pledge nor assign the delivery item as security. In the event of attachment, confiscation, or other disposition by third parties, the purchaser must notify the supplier immediately.
   </li>
 <li> In the event of breach of contract by the customer, particularly in the event of late payment, the supplier is entitled to take back the goods after issuing a reminder, and the customer is obligated to surrender them. The assertion of retention of title and the seizure of the delivery item by the supplier shall not be considered a withdrawal from the contract.
   </li> 
</ul>
 
   
<h4> VII. Liability for defects in delivery </h4>
<p class="condition-p"> For defects in the delivery, including the lack of expressly guaranteed characteristics, the supplier shall be liable to the exclusion of further claims, without prejudice to Section IX, 4, as follows:

</p>
<ul class="condition-ul">
 <li> All parts that prove to be unusable or significantly impaired in their usability within six months of commissioning due to a circumstance that occurred before the transfer of risk – in particular due to faulty design, poor construction materials, or poor workmanship – shall be repaired or replaced free of charge at the discretion of the supplier. The discovery of such defects must be reported to the supplier immediately in writing. Replaced parts become the property of the supplier. If shipment, installation, or commissioning is delayed through no fault of the supplier, liability expires at the latest 12 months after the transfer of risk. For essential third-party products, the supplier's liability is limited to the assignment of the liability claims to which it is entitled against the supplier of the third-party product.
   </li>
 <li> The purchaser's right to assert claims for defects shall in all cases expire within 6 months from the date of timely notification of the defect, but at the earliest upon expiry of the warranty period.
   </li>
 <li> No warranty is provided for damages caused by the following reasons: unsuitable or improper use, faulty assembly or commissioning by the customer or third parties, natural wear and tear, faulty or negligent handling, unsuitable operating materials, replacement materials, defective construction work, unsuitable building ground, chemical, electrochemical or electrical influences, unless they are due to a fault of the supplier.
   </li>
 <li> The Purchaser shall, after consultation with the Supplier, grant the Supplier the necessary time and opportunity to carry out all repairs and replacement deliveries that the Supplier deems necessary in its reasonable discretion. Otherwise, the Supplier shall be released from liability for defects. Only in urgent cases where operational safety is at risk and to prevent disproportionately large damage, in which case the Supplier must be notified immediately, or if the Supplier is in default of remedying the defect, does the Purchaser have the right to remedy the defect itself or have it remedied by a third party and to demand reimbursement of the necessary costs from the Supplier.
   </li>
 <li> Of the direct costs incurred by the repair or replacement delivery, the supplier shall bear, to the extent the complaint proves to be justified, the cost of the replacement part, including shipping, as well as the reasonable costs of removal and installation, and, if reasonably required in the individual case, the costs of providing its fitters and assistants. Otherwise, the customer shall bear the costs.
   </li>
</ul>
